# jujutracer
-----------

jujutracer is a simple ray tracer written in Julia. The code has been written alongside the lessons held for the [*Calcolo Numerico per la Generazione di Immagini Fotorealistiche*]() during the 2024 -2023 academic year @ UNIMI. The goal of this project is to provide the necessary framework to render photorealistic images based on radiometric principles, with also a basic language to define the scene to be rendered.
